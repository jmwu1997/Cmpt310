My KB will help others to know what they can build with the raw materials they have. User will tell all the raw materials they have and the program will tell them what they can make with their raw materials. For example if you have plastic & cables & overmolds & circuit_board & metal & key_matrix & processor & rom, you can make a mouse but one item short to make a keyboard. it will quickly find the items that you can make with the raw materials you have.
